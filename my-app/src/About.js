				Climate change is the long-term alteration of temperature and typical
				weather patterns in a place. ... The cause of current climate change is
				largely human activity, like burning fossil fuels, like natural gas,
				oil, and coal. Burning these materials releases what are called
				greenhouse gases into Earth's atmosphere.
